// Firebase web app — client-side SDK, loaded lazily.
//
// These values are the public Firebase web config (safe to ship to the browser;
// access is enforced by Firebase security rules, not by hiding this key). Used
// here only for Analytics — the app's own auth/data run on the Next.js server.
//
// `firebase/app` is deliberately NOT imported at the top level. A static import
// here would pull the SDK into the first-load JavaScript of every single page,
// because the analytics component runs in the root layout. Behind the dynamic
// import below it becomes its own chunk that loads after the page is
// interactive, so a phone on cell data isn't parsing the Firebase SDK before it
// can show anything. The `import type` is erased at compile time and costs
// nothing.
