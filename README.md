# SCAD Atlanta Distance — Team Hub

A private, full-stack team platform for a college running coach and his athletes.
It combines **personal workout scheduling** (like Garmin/Clipboard) with **team
communication** (like Band) in one clean dashboard — built specifically for a
distance squad, not a generic fitness app.

The coach can send personalized running schedules to ~20 athletes, message the whole
team or individuals, track who has completed each session, and read honest
post-workout feedback. Athletes get a focused view of their own training, a calendar,
their coach's messages, and a simple place to log how each run actually felt.

## ✨ Features

**Authentication & roles**
- Email/password sign up & log in, with secure HTTP-only session cookies (JWT).
- Two roles — **Coach/Admin** and **Athlete** — with strict, server-enforced access.
- Athletes only ever see their own schedule, feedback, and messages.

**Coach dashboard**
- Roster of all athletes with today's status at a glance.
- Add / edit / remove athletes (removal is a soft-archive that keeps history).
- Create a workout once and assign it to the **whole team** or **specific athletes**.
- Per-athlete custom notes on any assignment ("just for you").
- Week-completion %, "need to discuss" count, unread messages, and a live feed of
  recent athlete feedback (effort, how they felt, soreness flags).
- Upcoming-workout overview and per-athlete profiles with full feedback history.

**Athlete dashboard**
- Today's workout in full (warm-up / main set / cool-down, pace, location, links).
- A 7-day week strip and a complete schedule view.
- Quick status buttons: **Completed**, **Skipped**, **Need to discuss**.
- A post-workout feedback form: completion, effort (RPE 1–10), how you felt,
  soreness, and private notes for the coach.
- Latest team announcement and coach messages, with unread badges.

**Workout scheduling** — date, title, type, distance, pace/effort, warm-up, main set,
cool-down, notes, location, optional link, and team/individual assignment.

**Calendar** — clean month grid, color-coded by type (Easy, Workout, Long Run, Race,
Rest, Recovery). Coach sees the whole team; athletes see only their own sessions.

**Messaging (Band-style)** — a team announcement channel plus private coach↔athlete
threads, timestamps, unread indicators, and a simple chat UI.

**Privacy by design** — feedback, soreness notes, and messages are visible only to the
athlete and the coach. One athlete can never see another athlete's data.

| Database    | **SQLite** via **Prisma 6** (zero external services to set up)|
| Auth        | Custom JWT sessions (`jose`) in HTTP-only cookies, `bcryptjs` |

Everything runs locally with no cloud accounts or API keys required.

## 🚀 Getting started

> Requires **Node.js 18.18+** (developed on Node 22/25). npm comes with Node.

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (also generates the Prisma client)
npm install

# 2. Create the SQLite database and load demo data
#    (generates client, pushes the schema, seeds the real roster + 4-phase plan)
npm run setup

# 3. Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

Then open **http://localhost:3000**.

If you cloned this repo fresh and there is no `.env` file, create one first:

```bash
cp .env.example .env      # Windows PowerShell: copy .env.example .env
```

`.env` just needs a `DATABASE_URL` (SQLite file) and a `JWT_SECRET` — the example
file has sensible defaults for local development.

### Demo logins

The seed loads the real **SCAD Atlanta Cross Country** roster — 18 athletes in their
mileage groups (A/B/C) with personal pace targets — and the full **4-phase, 24-week
periodized plan** (6/8 → 11/22/2026) from the team's spreadsheet, with each athlete
placed on their group's workouts. **Password for every account is `password123`.** The
login screen also has one-click **Coach demo** / **Athlete demo** buttons.

| Role    | Email                |
| ------- | -------------------- |
| Coach   | `coach@scadxc.com`   |
| Athlete | `viren@scadxc.com`   |

## 🧭 A quick tour to show your coach

1. Click **Coach demo** on the login screen.
2. The **Dashboard** shows the roster, week completion, and a feed of real athlete
   feedback. Hit **New workout** → build a track session → assign it to the **whole
   team** or pick individual runners.
3. Open **Calendar** to see the color-coded training block; click any day to add a
   session on that date.
4. Open **Messages** → post a **team announcement**, or pick an athlete to DM.
5. Open **Athletes** → click a runner to see their mileage group, pace targets, and
   full feedback history (soreness notes included — visible only to you).
6. Sign out, then click **Athlete demo** to see the exact same data from a runner's
   side: today's workout, status buttons, the feedback form, and the coach's messages.

## 🗃️ Data model

- **Team** — name, season, coach, members.
- **User** — name, email, password hash, `role` (`COACH` | `ATHLETE`), and athlete
  profile fields (grad year, events, hometown, phone, emergency contact, personal
  bests, bio).
- **Workout** — title, date, `type`, `scope` (team/individual), distance, pace,
  warm-up, main set, cool-down, notes, location, link.
- **Assignment** — joins a workout to an athlete with a `status`
  (`ASSIGNED` → `VIEWED` → `COMPLETED` / `SKIPPED` / `NEEDS_DISCUSSION`), an optional
  per-athlete custom note, and view/respond timestamps. This is how one workout is
  assigned to many athletes and tracked per person.
- **Feedback** — completion, effort (1–10), how they felt, soreness, private notes.
- **Message** — `DIRECT` (coach↔athlete) or `ANNOUNCEMENT` (coach→team), with read
  state and timestamps.

> SQLite has no native enums, so role/type/status are stored as strings and validated
> in `src/lib/constants.ts` (the single source of truth).

## 🔒 Security notes

- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt; sessions are signed JWTs in `httpOnly`,
  `sameSite=lax` cookies.
- Every API route re-checks the session and role on the server (`requireUser` /
  `requireCoach`); the UI gating is convenience only.
- Athlete-owned actions verify ownership (an athlete can only respond to their own
  assignments and read their own feedback).

This is an MVP intended for a local demo. Before any real deployment, set a strong
`JWT_SECRET`, move to a hosted database (e.g. Postgres), and serve over HTTPS.
